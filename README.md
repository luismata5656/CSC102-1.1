## Week 2.2: Using JS

Created a simple color guessing game in `game.html`. I utilizzed the background color of the body element in order to show the color, then used `setTimout()` in order to change the color after x seconds. The user has to guess the color and type it in the input field. If the user guesses correctly, a message is displayed saying "Correct!". If the user guesses incorrectly, a message is displayed saying "Incorrect!".
