## Week 3.2: User Input

This assignment changes the content of `strings.html` in order to create a basic form that takes in a first name, last name, and a zipcode. If the combined name is less than 20 characters and the zipcode is a 5-digit number, there will be a secret message shown. Otherwise, an error message will be shown.
